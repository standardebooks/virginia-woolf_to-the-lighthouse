			<p>Then indeed peace had come. Messages of peace breathed from the sea to the shore. Never to break its sleep any more, to lull it rather more deeply to rest and whatever the dreamers dreamt holily, dreamt wisely, to confirm⁠—what else was it murmuring⁠—as Lily Briscoe laid her head on the pillow in the clean still room and heard the sea. Through the open window the voice of the beauty of the world came murmuring, too softly to hear exactly what it said⁠—but what mattered if the meaning were plain?⁠—entreating the sleepers (the house was full again; <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Beckwith was staying there, also <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Carmichael), if they would not actually come down to the beach itself at least to lift the blind and look out. They would see then night flowing down in purple; his head crowned; his sceptre jewelled; and how in his eyes a child might look. And if they still faltered (Lily was tired out with travelling and slept almost at once; but <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Carmichael read a book by candlelight), if they still said no, that it was vapour this splendour of his, and the dew had more power than he, and they preferred sleeping; gently then without complaint, or argument, the voice would sing its song. Gently the waves would break (Lily heard them in her sleep); tenderly the light fell (it seemed to come through her eyelids). And it all looked, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Carmichael thought, shutting his book, falling asleep, much as it used to look years ago.</p>
			<p>Indeed the voice might resume, as the curtains of dark wrapped themselves over the house, over <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Beckwith, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Carmichael, and Lily Briscoe so that they lay with several folds of blackness on their eyes, why not accept this, be content with this, acquiesce and resign? The sigh of all the seas breaking in measure round the isles soothed them; the night wrapped them; nothing broke their sleep, until, the birds beginning and the dawn weaving their thin voices in to its whiteness, a cart grinding, a dog somewhere barking, the sun lifted the curtains, broke the veil on their eyes, and Lily Briscoe stirring in her sleep clutched at her blankets as a faller clutches at the turf on the edge of a cliff. Her eyes opened wide. Here she was again, she thought, sitting bolt upright in bed. Awake.</p>
