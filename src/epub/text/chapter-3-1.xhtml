			<p>What does it mean then, what can it all mean? Lily Briscoe asked herself, wondering whether, since she had been left alone, it behoved her to go to the kitchen to fetch another cup of coffee or wait here. What does it mean?⁠—a catchword that was, caught up from some book, fitting her thought loosely, for she could not, this first morning with the Ramsays, contract her feelings, could only make a phrase resound to cover the blankness of her mind until these vapours had shrunk. For really, what did she feel, come back after all these years and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Ramsay dead? Nothing, nothing⁠—nothing that she could express at all.</p>
			<p>She had come late last night when it was all mysterious, dark. Now she was awake, at her old place at the breakfast table, but alone. It was very early too, not yet eight. There was this expedition⁠—they were going to the Lighthouse, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Ramsay, Cam, and James. They should have gone already⁠—they had to catch the tide or something. And Cam was not ready and James was not ready and Nancy had forgotten to order the sandwiches and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Ramsay had lost his temper and banged out of the room.</p>
			<p>“What’s the use of going now?” he had stormed.</p>
			<p>Nancy had vanished. There he was, marching up and down the terrace in a rage. One seemed to hear doors slamming and voices calling all over the house. Now Nancy burst in, and asked, looking round the room, in a queer half dazed, half desperate way, “What does one send to the Lighthouse?” as if she were forcing herself to do what she despaired of ever being able to do.</p>
			<p>What does one send to the Lighthouse indeed! At any other time Lily could have suggested reasonably tea, tobacco, newspapers. But this morning everything seemed so extraordinarily queer that a question like Nancy’s⁠—What does one send to the Lighthouse⁠—opened doors in one’s mind that went banging and swinging to and fro and made one keep asking, in a stupefied gape, What does one send? What does one do? Why is one sitting here after all?</p>
			<p>Sitting alone (for Nancy went out again) among the clean cups at the long table she felt cut off from other people, and able only to go on watching, asking, wondering. The house, the place, the morning, all seemed strangers to her. She had no attachment here, she felt, no relations with it, anything might happen, and whatever did happen, a step outside, a voice calling (“It’s not in the cupboard; it’s on the landing,” someone cried), was a question, as if the link that usually bound things together had been cut, and they floated up here, down there, off, anyhow. How aimless it was, how chaotic, how unreal it was, she thought, looking at her empty coffee cup. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Ramsay dead; Andrew killed; Prue dead too⁠—repeat it as she might, it roused no feeling in her. And we all get together in a house like this on a morning like this, she said, looking out of the window⁠—it was a beautiful still day.</p>
			<p>Suddenly <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Ramsay raised his head as he passed and looked straight at her, with his distraught wild gaze which was yet so penetrating, as if he saw you, for one second, for the first time, forever; and she pretended to drink out of her empty coffee cup so as to escape him⁠—to escape his demand on her, to put aside a moment longer that imperious need. And he shook his head at her, and strode on (“Alone” she heard him say, “Perished” she heard him say) and like everything else this strange morning the words became symbols, wrote themselves all over the grey-green walls. If only she could put them together, she felt, write them out in some sentence, then she would have got at the truth of things. Old <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Carmichael came padding softly in, fetched his coffee, took his cup and made off to sit in the sun. The extraordinary unreality was frightening; but it was also exciting. Going to the Lighthouse. But what does one send to the Lighthouse? Perished. Alone. The grey-green light on the wall opposite. The empty places. Such were some of the parts, but how bring them together? she asked. As if any interruption would break the frail shape she was building on the table she turned her back to the window lest <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Ramsay should see her. She must escape somehow, be alone somewhere. Suddenly she remembered. When she had sat there last ten years ago there had been a little sprig or leaf pattern on the tablecloth, which she had looked at in a moment of revelation. There had been a problem about a foreground of a picture. Move the tree to the middle, she had said. She had never finished that picture. It had been knocking about in her mind all these years. She would paint that picture now. Where were her paints, she wondered? Her paints, yes. She had left them in the hall last night. She would start at once. She got up quickly, before <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Ramsay turned.</p>
			<p>She fetched herself a chair. She pitched her easel with her precise old maidish movements on the edge of the lawn, not too close to <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Carmichael, but close enough for his protection. Yes, it must have been precisely here that she had stood ten years ago. There was the wall; the hedge; the tree. The question was of some relation between those masses. She had borne it in her mind all these years. It seemed as if the solution had come to her: she knew now what she wanted to do.</p>
			<p>But with <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Ramsay bearing down on her, she could do nothing. Every time he approached⁠—he was walking up and down the terrace⁠—ruin approached, chaos approached. She could not paint. She stooped, she turned; she took up this rag; she squeezed that tube. But all she did was to ward him off a moment. He made it impossible for her to do anything. For if she gave him the least chance, if he saw her disengaged a moment, looking his way a moment, he would be on her, saying, as he had said last night, “You find us much changed.” Last night he had got up and stopped before her, and said that. Dumb and staring though they had all sat, the six children whom they used to call after the Kings and Queens of England⁠—the Red, the Fair, the Wicked, the Ruthless⁠—she felt how they raged under it. Kind old <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Beckwith said something sensible. But it was a house full of unrelated passions⁠—she had felt that all the evening. And on top of this chaos <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Ramsay got up, pressed her hand, and said: “You will find us much changed,” and none of them had moved or had spoken; but had sat there as if they were forced to let him say it. Only James (certainly the Sullen) scowled at the lamp; and Cam screwed her handkerchief round her finger. Then he reminded them that they were going to the Lighthouse tomorrow. They must be ready, in the hall, on the stroke of half-past seven. Then, with his hand on the door, he stopped; he turned upon them. Did they not want to go? he demanded. Had they dared say No (he had some reason for wanting it) he would have flung himself tragically backwards into the bitter waters of despair. Such a gift he had for gesture. He looked like a king in exile. Doggedly James said yes. Cam stumbled more wretchedly. Yes, oh yes, they’d both be ready, they said. And it struck her, this was tragedy⁠—not palls, dust, and the shroud; but children coerced, their spirits subdued. James was sixteen, Cam seventeen, perhaps. She had looked round for someone who was not there, for <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Ramsay, presumably. But there was only kind <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Beckwith turning over her sketches under the lamp. Then, being tired, her mind still rising and falling with the sea, the taste and smell that places have after long absence possessing her, the candles wavering in her eyes, she had lost herself and gone under. It was a wonderful night, starlit; the waves sounded as they went upstairs; the moon surprised them, enormous, pale, as they passed the staircase window. She had slept at once.</p>
			<p>She set her clean canvas firmly upon the easel, as a barrier, frail, but she hoped sufficiently substantial to ward off <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Ramsay and his exactingness. She did her best to look, when his back was turned, at her picture; that line there, that mass there. But it was out of the question. Let him be fifty feet away, let him not even speak to you, let him not even see you, he permeated, he prevailed, he imposed himself. He changed everything. She could not see the colour; she could not see the lines; even with his back turned to her, she could only think, But he’ll be down on me in a moment, demanding⁠—something she felt she could not give him. She rejected one brush; she chose another. When would those children come? When would they all be off? she fidgeted. That man, she thought, her anger rising in her, never gave; that man took. She, on the other hand, would be forced to give. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Ramsay had given. Giving, giving, giving, she had died⁠—and had left all this. Really, she was angry with <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Ramsay. With the brush slightly trembling in her fingers she looked at the hedge, the step, the wall. It was all <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Ramsay’s doing. She was dead. Here was Lily, at forty-four, wasting her time, unable to do a thing, standing there, playing at painting, playing at the one thing one did not play at, and it was all <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Ramsay’s fault. She was dead. The step where she used to sit was empty. She was dead.</p>
			<p>But why repeat this over and over again? Why be always trying to bring up some feeling she had not got? There was a kind of blasphemy in it. It was all dry: all withered: all spent. They ought not to have asked her; she ought not to have come. One can’t waste one’s time at forty-four, she thought. She hated playing at painting. A brush, the one dependable thing in a world of strife, ruin, chaos⁠—that one should not play with, knowingly even: she detested it. But he made her. You shan’t touch your canvas, he seemed to say, bearing down on her, till you’ve given me what I want of you. Here he was, close upon her again, greedy, distraught. Well, thought Lily in despair, letting her right hand fall at her side, it would be simpler then to have it over. Surely she could imitate from recollection the glow, the rhapsody, the self-surrender she had seen on so many women’s faces (on <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Ramsay’s, for instance), when on some occasion like this they blazed up⁠—she could remember the look on <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Ramsay’s face⁠—into a rapture of sympathy, of delight in the reward they had, which, though the reason of it escaped her, evidently conferred on them the most supreme bliss of which human nature was capable. Here he was, stopped by her side. She would give him what she could.</p>
